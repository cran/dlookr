## Preface
After you have acquired the data, you should do the following:

* Diagnose data quality.
    + If there is a problem with data quality,
    + The data must be corrected or re-acquired.
* Explore data to understand the data and find scenarios for performing the analysis.
* **Derive new variables or perform variable transformations.**

The dlookr package makes these steps fast and easy:

* Performs an data diagnosis or automatically generates a data diagnosis report.
* Discover data in a variety of ways, and automatically generate EDA(exploratory data analysis) report.
* **Imputate missing values and outliers, resolve skewed data, and binarize continuous variables into categorical variables. And generates an automated report to support it.**

This document introduces **data transformation** methods provided by the dlookr package. You will learn how to transform of `tbl_df` data that inherits from data.frame and `data.frame` with functions provided by dlookr.

dlookr synergy with `dplyr` increases. Particularly in data transformation and data wrangle, it increases the efficiency of the `tidyverse` package group.

## datasets
To illustrate the basic use of EDA in the dlookr package, I use a `Carseats` datasets.
`Carseats` in the `ISLR` package is simulation dataset that sells children's car seats at 400 stores. This data is a data.frame created for the purpose of predicting sales volume.

```{r import_data}
library(ISLR)
str(Carseats)
```

The contents of individual variables are as follows. (Refer to ISLR::Carseats Man page)

* Sales
    + Unit sales (in thousands) at each location
* CompPrice
    + Price charged by competitor at each location
* Income
    + Community income level (in thousands of dollars)
* Advertising
    + Local advertising budget for company at each location (in thousands of dollars)
* Population
    + Population size in region (in thousands)
* Price
    + Price company charges for car seats at each site
* ShelveLoc
    + A factor with levels Bad, Good and Medium indicating the quality of the shelving location for the car seats at each site
* Age
    + Average age of the local population
* Education
    + Education level at each location
* Urban
    + A factor with levels No and Yes to indicate whether the store is in an urban or rural location
* US
    + A factor with levels No and Yes to indicate whether the store is in the US or not

When data analysis is performed, data containing missing values is often encountered. However, Carseats is complete data without missing. Therefore, the missing values are generated as follows. And I created a data.frame object named carseats.

```{r missing}
carseats <- ISLR::Carseats

set.seed(123)
carseats[sample(seq(NROW(carseats)), 20), "Income"] <- NA

set.seed(456)
carseats[sample(seq(NROW(carseats)), 10), "Urban"] <- NA
```

## Data Transformation
dlookr imputates missing values and outliers and resolves skewed data. It also provides the ability to bin continuous variables as categorical variables.

Here is a list of the data conversion functions and functions provided by dlookr:

* `find_na()` finds a variable that contains the missing values variable, and `imputate_na()` imputates the missing values.
* `find_outliers()` finds a variable that contains the outliers, and `imputate_outlier()` imputates the outlier.
* `summary.imputation()` and `plot.imputation()` provide information and visualization of the imputated variables.
* `find_skewness()` finds the variables of the skewed data, and `transform()` performs the resolving of the skewed data.
* `transform()` also performs standardization of numeric variables.
* `summary.transform()` and `plot.transform()` provide information and visualization of transformed variables.
* `binning()` and `binning_by()` convert binational data into categorical data.
* `print.bins()` and `summary.bins()` show and summarize the binning results.
* `plot.bins()` and `plot.optimal_bins()` provide visualization of the binning result.
* `transformation_report()` performs the data transform and reports the result.


## Imputation of missing values
### Imputates the missing value with `imputate_na()`

`imputate_na()` imputates the missing value in the variable. The predictor with missing values supports both numeric and categorical variables and supports the following methods.

* predictor is numerical variable
    + "mean" : arithmetic mean
    + "median" : median
    + "mode" : mode
    + "knn" : K-nearest neighbors
        + target variable must be specified
    + "rpart" : Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees
        + target variable must be specified    
    + "mice" : Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations
        + target variable must be specified  
        + random seed must be set
* predictor is categorical variable
    + "mode" : mode
    + "rpart" : Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees
        + target variable must be specified    
    + "mice" : Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations
        + target variable must be specified  
        + random seed must be set
    
`imputate_na()` imputates the missing value with "rpart" for the numeric variable, `Income`.
`summary()` summarizes missing value imputation information, and `plot()` visualizes imputation information.

```{r imputate_na, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
income <- imputate_na(carseats, Income, US, method = "rpart")

# result of imputate
income

# summary of imputate
summary(income)

# viz of imputate
plot(income)
```

The following imputates the categorical variable `urban` by the "mice" method.

```{r imputate_na2, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
library(mice)

urban <- imputate_na(carseats, Urban, US, method = "mice")

# result of imputate
urban

# summary of imputate
summary(urban)

# viz of imputate
plot(urban)
```
    
### Collaboration with dplyr
The following is an example of calculating the arithmetic mean of `US` variables by using the `Income` variable that imputates the missing value with `dplyr`.

```{r imputate_na3}
# The mean before and after the imputation of the Income variable
carseats %>%
  mutate(Income_imp = imputate_na(carseats, Income, US, method = "knn")) %>%
  group_by(US) %>%
  summarise(orig = mean(Income, na.rm = TRUE),
    imputation = mean(Income_imp))
```


## Imputation of outliers
### Imputates thr outliers with `imputate_outlier()`

`imputate_outlier()` imputates the outliers value. The predictor with outliers supports only numeric variables and supports the following methods.

* predictor is numerical variable
    + "mean" : arithmetic mean
    + "median" : median
    + "mode" : mode
    + "capping" : Imputate the upper outliers with 95 percentile, and Imputate the bottom outliers with 5 percentile.

`imputate_outlier()` imputates the outliers with the numeric variable `Price` as the "capping" method, as follows. `summary()` summarizes outliers imputation information, and `plot()` visualizes imputation information.

```{r imputate_outlier, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
price <- imputate_outlier(carseats, Price, method = "capping")

# result of imputate
price

# summary of imputate
summary(price)

# viz of imputate
plot(price)
```

### Collaboration with dplyr
The following is an example of calculating the arithmetic mean of `US` variables by using the `Price` variable that imputates the outlier with `dplyr`.

```{r imputate_outlier2}
# The mean before and after the imputation of the Price variable
carseats %>%
  mutate(Price_imp = imputate_outlier(carseats, Price, method = "capping")) %>%
  group_by(US) %>%
  summarise(orig = mean(Price, na.rm = TRUE),
    imputation = mean(Price_imp, na.rm = TRUE))
```
    

## Standardization and Resolving Skewness
### Introduction to the use of `transform()`
`transform()` performs data transformation. Only numeric variables are supported, and the following methods are provided.

* Standardization
    + "zscore" : z-score transformation. (x - mu) / sigma
    + "minmax" : minmax transformation. (x - min) / (max - min)
* Resolving Skewness
    + "log" : log transformation. log(x)
    + "log+1" : log transformation. log(x + 1). Used for values that contain 0.
    + "sqrt" : square root transformation.
    + "1/x" : 1 / x transformation
    + "x^2" : x square transformation
    + "x^3" : x^3 square transformation

### Standardization with `transform()`
Use the methods "zscore" and "minmax" to perform standardization.

```{r standardization, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
carseats %>% 
  mutate(Income_minmax = transform(carseats$Income, method = "minmax"),
    Sales_minmax = transform(carseats$Sales, method = "minmax")) %>% 
  select(Income_minmax, Sales_minmax) %>% 
  boxplot()
```

### Resolving Skewness data with `transform()`
`find_skewness()` calculates the skewness and finds the skewed data.

```{r resolving1}
# find index of skewed variables
find_skewness(carseats)

# find names of skewed variables
find_skewness(carseats, index = FALSE)

# compute the skewness
find_skewness(carseats, value = TRUE)

# compute the skewness & filtering with threshold
find_skewness(carseats, value = TRUE, thres = 0.1)
```

The skewness of `Advertising` is 0.637, which is a little slanted to the left, so I use `transformation ()` to convert it to `log`.
`summary()` summarizes the transformation information, and `plot()` visualizes the transformation information.

```{r resolving2, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
Advertising_log = transform(carseats$Advertising, method = "log")

# result of transformation
head(Advertising_log)
# summary of transformation
summary(Advertising_log)
# viz of transformation
plot(Advertising_log)
```

It seems that the raw data contains 0, as there is a -Inf in the log converted value. So this time we convert it to "log + 1".

```{r resolving3, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
Advertising_log <- transform(carseats$Advertising, method = "log+1")

# result of transformation
head(Advertising_log)
# summary of transformation
summary(Advertising_log)
# viz of transformation
plot(Advertising_log)
```

## Binning
### Binning of individual variables using `binning()`

`binning()` transforms a numeric variable into a categorical variable by binning it. The following types of binning are supported.

* "quantile" : categorize using quantile to include the same frequencies
* "equal" : categorize to have equal length segments
* "pretty" : categorized into moderately good segments
* "kmeans" : categorization using K-means clustering
* "bclust" : categorization using bagged clustering technique

The following example illustrates some ways to `Income` binning using `binning()`.:

```{r binning, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5}
# Binning the carat variable. default type argument is "quantile"
bin <- binning(carseats$Income)
# Print bins class object
bin
# Summarise bins class object
summary(bin)
# Plot bins class object
plot(bin)
# Using labels argument
bin <- binning(carseats$Income, nbins = 4,
              labels = c("LQ1", "UQ1", "LQ3", "UQ3"))
bin
# Using another type argument
binning(carseats$Income, nbins = 5, type = "equal")
binning(carseats$Income, nbins = 5, type = "pretty")
binning(carseats$Income, nbins = 5, type = "kmeans")
binning(carseats$Income, nbins = 5, type = "bclust")

# -------------------------
# Using pipes & dplyr
# -------------------------
library(dplyr)

carseats %>%
 mutate(Income_bin = binning(carseats$Income)) %>%
 group_by(ShelveLoc, Income_bin) %>%
 summarise(freq = n()) %>%
 arrange(desc(freq)) %>%
 head(10)
```
    
### Optimal Binning with `binning_by()`

`binning_by()` converts a numeric variable into a categorical variable by optimal binning. This method is often used when developing a `scorecard model`.

The following `binning_by()` example optimally binning `Advertising` if `US` is a target variable with a binary class.

```{r binning_by, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5}
# optimal binning
bin <- binning_by(carseats, "US", "Advertising")
bin

# summary optimal_bins class
summary(bin)

# information value 
attr(bin, "iv")

# information value table
attr(bin, "ivtable")

# visualize optimal_bins class
plot(bin, sub = "bins of Advertising variable")
```

## Creating a data transformation report using `transformation_report()`
`transformation_report()` creates a data transformation report for all the variables in the data frame or objects that inherit the data frame (`tbl_df`, `tbl`, etc.).

`transformation_report()` creates a data transformation report in two forms:

* pdf file based on Latex
* html file

The contents of the report are as follows.:

* Imputation
    + Missing Values
        + Missing values imputation information
        + (variable names)
    + Outliers
        + Outliers imputation information
        + (variable names)
* Resolving Skewness
    + Skewed variables information
        + (variable names)
* Binning
    + Numerical Variables for Binning
    + Binning
        + (variable names)
    + Optimal Binning
        + (variable names)

The following creates a data transformation report for `carseats`. The file format is pdf, and the file name is `Transformation_Report.pdf`.

```{r trans_report, eval=FALSE}
carseats %>%
  transformation_report(target = US)
```

The following generates a report in html format called `transformation.html`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
carseats %>%
  transformation_report(target = US, output_format = "html", 
    output_file = "transformation.html")
```

Data transformation reports are automated reports to assist in the data transformation process. Design data conversion scenarios by referring to the report results.

### Data transformation report contents
#### Contents of pdf file
* The cover of the report is shown in the following figure.

```{r trans_title_pdf, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center', fig.pos="!h", fig.cap="Data transformation report cover"}
